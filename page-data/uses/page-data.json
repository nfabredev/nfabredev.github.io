It's worth spending some time configuring your tools so that you can get the most value out of them. This page also plays the role of a living guide for myself when I need to setup a new development environment. After having to set this up, like, 4 time in the past year, I decided to write this down and automate this as much as I can.</p>\n<h3>Hardware:</h3>\n<p><strong>Computer</strong>: MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2019, 2,8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB of RAM and a SSD of 500 Gb</p>\n<p><strong>Screen</strong>: Samsung 4K 28\" U28R55</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard</strong> and mouse: Magic Keyboard and Magic trackpad 2</p>\n<p><strong>Headphones</strong>: still looking for a nice headset, ping me for your recommendations. Currenlty using Ticpods Free or Sennheiser Momentum.</p>\n<p><strong>Ereader</strong>: Kobo Libra H2O for reading.</p>\n<h3>Software:</h3>\n<p>Some of the noteworthy pieces of software that I use (almost) everyday:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">Iterm 2</a> with <a href=\"https://www.zsh.org/\">Zsh</a>, <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh My ZSH</a> to manage the configuration, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure\">pure</a> prompt.</p>\n<p>VSCode with plenty of nice extensions, check this article about my favs <a href=\"https://nfabredev.com/top-vscode-extensions\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12\">Amphetamine</a>, to use the computer with the lid closed, handy at work with a dual monitor setup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave browser</a> for its privacy features</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com/\">Calibre</a> to manage my e-books</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://justgetflux.com/news/pages/mac/\">f.lux</a> to manage the color of my screen according to the time of the day</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12\">FlyCut</a> as a clipboard manager</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.keka.io/en/\">Keka</a> for compressing and decompressing every type of format (eg.: 7-zip on mac)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> for flexible and shared notes that can be arranged to do nearly anything you wish</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rectangleapp.com/\">Rectangle</a> as a replacement to the loved <a href=\"https://www.spectacleapp.com/\">Spectacle</a> for window management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/soroushchehresa/unsplash-wallpapers\">Unsplash Wallpapers</a> for fresh desktop backgrounds</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/\">Vanilla</a> to manage the menu bar real estate</p>\n<h3>Setting up a new computer</h3>\n<p>So now the qustion is: How to re-install all of these applications, plus many others, including development dependencies, runtimes, databases management sytems, all kind of binaries without spending hours on it ?</p>\n<p>I'm using a not-so-new-anymore feature that landed in <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Brew</a>, which is the <a href=\"https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#bundle-subcommand\">bundle</a> command.</p>\n<p>Use <code class=\"language-text\">brew bundle dump</code> to dump all your installed dependencies in a Brewfile, then check the list and add any missing application.\nTo do that you can use <code class=\"language-text\">brew search</code> for any applications - eg.: <code class=\"language-text\">brew search kubectl</code>.\nFor applications distributed on the App Store use <a href=\"https://github.com/mas-cli/mas\">mas cli</a>. Use <code class=\"language-text\">mas list</code> and then add these to your Brewfile.\nOnce your Brewfile is created you'll only need to install brew and run <code class=\"language-text\">brew bundle</code> to setup up all you apps.</p>\n<p>Now how to bring this file, and your dotfiles, on a new computer ? I personally version them in Github, and then symlink them in my home. You can create a simple bash script to do that. Check the latest version of these files <a href=\"https://github.com/nfabredev/.dotfiles\">here</a></p>\n<p>I use a signed in browser profile with Google Chrome which syncs my browser extensions.</p>\n<p>VSCode settings are synced with <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync\">Setting Sync</a> native feature in the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">insider release</a> and / or with <a href=\"https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync\">Settings Sync</a> MarketPlace extension in the regular release that saves everything to github gists.</p>\n<p>Passwords, ssh keys and plenty of stuff is managed using a password manager.</p>\n<p>Pictures, documents go on the cloud ☁️.</p>\n<p>That's about it for now, I'll update this as my practice change.

Makes missing a closing parentheses impossible</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JakeKantzer/vscode-case-sensitive-add-next\">Case-Sensitive Add Next Occurrence</a>: when you work with multi-cursor selection and want to select NextOccurence but not nextoccurence. Combine this with the String Manipulation extension and let the magic happen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/egonyans/vscode-ext-color-highlight\">Color highlight</a>: superpower that lets you highlight color codes with the actual color they represent, so you can tell which one of #38cdf2 or #2a93ad is a darker blue.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad\">GistPad</a>: turn your gists into your favorite note taking app, supports any filetypes, embeds images and comment on gists.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens\">GitLens</a>: commit with a GUI, diff file per file, staging line by line, check the list of past commits and the changes they brought. Great to pick out a commit ID for a quick fixup.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share\">Live Share</a>: absolute life saver when it comes to remote pair coding, so you can invite a friend over your workspace, edit files, debug and serve your app or run terminal commands together on your computer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ChristianKohler/PathIntellisense\">Path intellisense</a>: make those import strings aware of your directory structure so you can't mistype an import path anymore.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marclipovsky/vscode-string-manipulation\">String manipulation</a>: big time saver to switch between different casing of strings like PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case, the aptly named SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE and others..</li>\n<li>There's plenty of good themes and icon options for VSCode and everyone has different taste when it comes to that but some big hits for me were: <a href=\"https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode\">SynthWave 84'</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode\">Shades of Purple</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme\">Material Icon Theme</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell me about yours !</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"VSCode extensions","date":"May 10, 2020","description":"My top VSCode extensions"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/top-vscode-extensions/","previous":{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"fields":{"slug":"/terminal-magic/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Terminal magic"}}}},"next":{"node":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"fields":{"slug":"/uses/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What I use"}}}}}},
